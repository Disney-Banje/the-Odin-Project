# Tables best practices
. Left-align text columns: Everything that's made up of letters should be left aligned

. Match heading alignment to column: Column names (headers, heads, titles) should always be aligned to their column content, to reduce visual noise.

.Right-align numeric columns: It is much easier to compare and contrast when aligned to the right, the goal being alignment according to the position of the decimal.

.Use tabular typography: It is advisable to use monospace font for numerical values. This allows characters to have the same size.
